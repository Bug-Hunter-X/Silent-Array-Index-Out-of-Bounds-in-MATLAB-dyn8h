This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in MATLAB related to array indexing.  When attempting to access an element beyond the array's bounds, MATLAB does not throw an error in many cases, leading to unexpected behavior or silent failures. The bug.m file contains the erroneous code, and bugSolution.m provides a corrected version with proper bounds checking. This scenario highlights the importance of careful array indexing in MATLAB to prevent hidden errors.
